\title{Read the brain mesh and its brain regions from the MouseLight project}
\usage{
mouselight_read_brain(
  type = c("outline", "brain_areas"),
  progress = TRUE,
  Force = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{whether just to retreive the outer brain mesh, or the brain constituent neuropils}

\item{progress}{logical, toggle progress bar}

\item{Force}{logical, whether or not to overwrite .obj files stored in a temporary directory}

\item{...}{methods passed to \code{mouselight_fetch}}
}
\value{
a \code{nat} package \code{\link[nat]{hxsurf}} object, which mimics the Amira surface format, replete with metadata that can be
accessed using \code{$}
}
\description{
Save  the brain mesh and its brain regions from the MouseLight project
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## First we can quickly just plot the outer mesh for the brain
outline = mouselight_read_brain(type = "outline")
plot3d(outline, col = "pink", alpha = 0.3)

## This is cool, but maybe what we really want are its sub-divisions.
mousebrain = mouselight_read_brain(type = "brain_areas")
clear3d()
plot3d(mousebrain)
### This takes a long time the first time you call this function per session

## What brain regions are on offer?
print(mousebrain$neuropil_full_names)

## Or if we want more information, we can get it like this:
mbr = mouselight_brain_region_info()
View(mouselight_brain_region_info)

## Perhaps we want to plot just the amygdala?
### To do this we can do
amygdala.codes = mousebrain$RegionList[grepl("amygdala",
mousebrain$neuropil_full_names,
ignore.case = TRUE)]
plot3d(outline, col = "pink", alpha = 0.1)
plot3d(subset(mousebrain, amygdala.codes), alpha = 0.5)
