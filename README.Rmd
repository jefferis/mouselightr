# Mouselightr

The goal of *mouselightr* is to provide R client utilities for interacting with the [MouseLight](http://mouselight.janelia.org/) at [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/), which has [successfully](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdfExtended/S0896-6273(19)30391-5) acquired and registered almost ~1,000 neurons from the mouse into a standard, annotated template space. MouseLight investigators have acquired sub-micron single neuron reconstructions from two-photon microscopy datasets of whole brainsusing modified tissue clearing techniques, and have generated a template brain with defined sub-volumes. Using this R package in concert with the [natverse](https://github.com/natverse/natverse) ecosystem of neuroanatomy tools is highly recommended. 

## Installation

Firstly, you will need R, R Studio and X Quartz as well as nat and its dependencies. For detailed installation instructions for all this, see [here](https://natverse.github.io/nat/articles/Installation.html). It should not take too long at all. Then:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("natverse/mouselightr")

# use 
library(mouselightr)
```

Done!

## Key Functions

Now we can have a look at what is available, here are some of the key functions. Their help details examples of their use. You can summon the help in RStudio using `?` followed by the function name.

```{r help, eval = FALSE}
# And how can I download and read neurons?
?mouselight_read_neurons()

# Get useful information on the neurons available
?mouselight_neuron_info()

# Get a 3D neuropil-subdivided brain model
?mouselight_read_brain # Get 3D neuropil-subdivided brain models for those brainspaces
```

## Example

Let's also have a look at an example pulling neurons and brain meshes from the [MouseLight neuron browser](https://mouselightr.neuro.mpg.de). Excitingly, all the data is in a single standard template space!

```{r mouselightr.example, eval = FALSE}
## First we can quickly just plot the outer mesh for the brain
outline = mouselight_read_brain(type = "outline")
plot3d(outline, col = "pink", alpha = 0.3)

## This is cool, but maybe what we really want are its sub-divisions.
mousebrain = mouselight_read_brain(type = "brain_areas")
clear3d()
plot3d(mousebrain)
### This takes a long time the first time you call this function per session
### .obj files are saved in a temporary folders
### You could save this brain locally, to use quickly in future.
#### save(mousebrain,"YOUR_PATH/mouselight_brain.rda")

## What brain regions are on offer?
print(mousebrain$neuropil_full_names)

## Or if we want more information, we can get it like this:
mbr = mouselight_brain_region_info()
View(mbr)

## Perhaps we want to plot just the amygdala?
### To do this we can do
amygdala.codes = mousebrain$RegionList[grepl("amygdala",mousebrain$neuropil_full_names,
ignore.case = TRUE)]
plot3d(outline, col = "pink", alpha = 0.1)
plot3d(subset(mousebrain, amygdala.codes), alpha = 0.5)

## So now we want some neurons
## What neurons data is available?
ndf=mouselight_neuron_info()
#### How many tracings per neurons?
table(table(ndf$neuron.id))
#### This is because many 'neurons' have a separate axon and dendrite skeleton 

## We can download all of these neurons, and their meta-data
### Typically two tracings, and axon and a dendrite, per neuron
mlns = mouselight_read_neurons(ndf$tracing.id, meta = TRUE)

## Let's read in all the amygdalal neurons
### Since each 
in.amyg = mouselight_nodes_in_region(mlns, brain.areas = amygdala.codes, labels = NULL)
amyg.ids = names(in.amyg)[in.amyg>0]
amyg.neurons = mlns[amyg.ids]

## And plot!
plot3d(amyg.neurons)
### Quite wide-ranging!
```
